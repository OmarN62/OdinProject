    <h2>Description of Ribs</h2>
    <p>BBQ ribs are a smoky, tender masterpiece, dripping with rich, tangy barbecue sauce that caramelizes perfectly as they’re cooked low and slow. The way the meat falls off the bone and melts in your mouth is pure satisfaction, balancing savory, sweet, and sometimes spicy flavors in every bite. Whether slathered in a bold, peppery sauce or a sweeter honey glaze, ribs are the centerpiece of any backyard cookout or barbecue feast. They’re my favorite food because they’re indulgent, messy, and utterly delicious—a treat that feels like a celebration every time, bringing a sense of joy and nostalgia with every bite.</p>
